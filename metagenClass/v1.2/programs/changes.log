-- v1.00 
- first completed release, mai programs are in bin folder.
- for blast sequences are grouped in files with 2K reads each.
- in theory the number of used paralel blast searches can be increased to 33 assuming m5a.24xlarge (better try with 32 first)

-- v1.01 
- reorganized pipeline to blast only the sequences that are identified as tarket viruses with kraken
- blast took 37 minuts at 96 cores vs 12-20 hours

-- v1.2.0
- filtering by length occurs at the same time as merging (min len 100)
- filtering of kraken and blast results is done with R (faster)
- removed most of the intermidiate files and directories for filtering results
- blast rrsults are filtered to include only top hits (currently 1)
- if target virus is not in top blast match for a read then read is removed
- number of programs to run a pipeline is reduced to 13
- most of the programs run in parallel for each sample
